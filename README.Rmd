`smartabaseR` is an R package that lets you connect R to Smartabase. At its core, `smartabaseR` acts as a wrapper for the Smartabase API.

`sb_get_event()` returns a flat export of your Smartabase data. From there you can leverage R's rich data wrangling, statistics and machine learning capabilities. 

`sb_insert_event()` sends data from R to Smartabase.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `smartabaseR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
      
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Teamworksapp/smartabaseR")
```

## Security

`smartabaseR` respects all the same permissions as if you were interacting with the Smartabase web app or a Smartabase mobile app. For example, if you don't have access to a certain form in Smartabase, then you won't have access to that form via `smartabaseR`. Likewise, if you have delete access to a certain form in Smartabase, then you can also delete data from that form with `smartabaseR`.

`smartabaseR` is a powerful tool. It can level up your automation and analytics processes but there is potential for damage if you have not:

1. read all the documentation
2. undertaken extensive testing before putting into production
3. reached out to your Smartabase consultant when/if you have any questions and/or concerns


## Getting started

It's important to think about how you provide credentials to `smartabaseR`. You can read more about that here: `vignette("credentials")`.

## Usage

The two main functions of `smartabaseR` allow you to export/import data from/to your Smartabase site via the Smartabase API.

#### sb_get_event()

The `sb_get_event()` function allows you to export data from a specific Smartabase form into an R session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sb_get_event(
  form = "Example Form",
  date_range = c("01/03/2023", "07/03/2023"),
  url = "example.smartabase.com/site",
  username = "example.username",
  password = "example_password"
)
```

#### sb_insert_event()

The `sb_insert_event()` function allows you to send data back to a Smartabase form:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sb_insert_event(
  df = data,
  form = "Example Form",
  url = "example.smartabase.com/site",
  username = "example.username",
  password = "example_password"
)
```
